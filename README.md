# ðŸª£ Epoxy

Simple server-side per-route html injection

## Purpose

Epoxy allows for running middleware on select HTTP routes that inject HTML into the served content.
Simply point it at a static directory, define some routes in a script and you're off to the races! :horse:

Epoxy comes with `esbuild`, which is used for transpiling a route handler file.

## Usage

Add as a dependency

```bash
yarn add @stevent-team/epoxy
```

### Options

You can also run `npx epoxy --help` to see this information.

#### `epoxy`

```
Usage: epoxy <target> [routeFile] [options]

Serve the provided static folder

Arguments:
  target                 Path to static directory
  routeFile              Path to cjs router script (can use ES6 with --build option)

Options:
  -V, --version          output the version number
  -p, --port <port>      port to use for http server (default: 8080)
  -h, --host <url>       host to use for http server (default: "0.0.0.0")
  -i, --index <path>     path to index html inside of target (default: "index.html")
  -b, --build            build routes file in memory (default: false)
  --no-cache             disable all route handler result caching
  --help                 display help for command
```

#### `epoxy build`

```
Usage: epoxy build <routeFile> [options]

Build a routes file

Arguments:
  routeFile                Path to ES6 router script

Options:
  -o, --outputDir <path>   folder to output built routes file (default: "dist")
  -h, --help               display help for command
```

## Example

Create a script to define your dynamic routes.

```js
// Handlers are async functions returning HTML to be injected
const routeHandler = async req => {
  const { params } = req // Get route params from request

  return {
    head: `<meta property="coolness" value="${params.coolness}">`, // Injected into the end of the <head>
    body: 'Howdy!' // Injected into the end of the <body>
  }
}

export default {
  '/some/route/with/:coolness': routeHandler
}
```

  <summary>See an example using the `createMeta` helper</summary>

  > ### `createMeta` Helper
  >
  > Epoxy comes with a helper that allows you to easily create meta tags from an object.
  >
  > ```js
  > import { createMeta } from '@stevent-team/epoxy/helpers'
  >
  > const routeHandler = async ({ params }) => {
  >   // Create a string of meta tags from the object passed in
  >   const metaTags = createMeta({
  >     coolness: params.coolness,
  >     description: 'A pretty cool page',
  >   })
  >
  >   return { head: metaTags }
  > }
  >
  > export default {
  >   '/route/:coolness': routeHandler
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > For more information about the helpers available in Epoxy, see the [readme](./helpers/README.md).
</details>

Then serve your static directory and dynamic routes!

```bash
epoxy ./dist ./routes.js --build
```

or setup an npm script

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "epoxy ./dist ./routes.js --build"
  }
}
```

If you have a deployment that will need to start and stop your Epoxy server often, such as an automatically scaled deployment like Google App Engine, then you can prebuild the routes file so it doesn't have to build before every start:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "epoxy build ./routes.js",
    "serve": "epoxy ./dist ./dist/routes.js"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you could also write your routes file in CommonJS so it doesn't require building; the `epoxy` command only builds if the flag `--build` is specified.

## API

Your route handler will be built by Epoxy using Parcel when Epoxy is started. It also has to export a default object with the structure:

```js
export default {
  'express/js/route/:withParams': yourRouteHandlerFunction
}

// or

export default {
  'express/js/route/:withParams': {
    handler: yourRouteHandlerFunction,
    key: request => ['A key to cache with', request.params.withParams], // optional, any type, will cache result based on key
    ttl: 3600000, // time to live, optional, in milliseconds
  }
}
```

If you include a `key` that is not undefined, then the result of the handler function will be cached based on that key. You can also include a time to live `ttl` parameter which will expire the cache after a certain amount of milliseconds. There is also a command line argument `--no-cache` that will disable all caching irrespective of any keys provided.

Each route must have a function to handle it, which will receive a `request` object from ExpressJS, from which you can learn about the request. See the express docs for the [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) for more information.
